        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm Kyle Herman! I'm currently studying to improve my coding skills and hope to become a project manager or work on a game development team in the future.</p>
        <p>In the past, I worked as a lifeguard and currently repair computers for a living. I also enjoy working on various programming projects, including Arduino and game development.</p>
        <p>One fun fact about me: I can't handle spicy food!</p>
        <p>Check out some of my projects:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#">Interactive Comic</a> - A digital comic experience that combines storytelling with interactive elements, allowing readers to influence the narrative.</li>
            <li><a href="#">Solo Platformer</a> - A single-player platforming game featuring unique level designs, fluid movement, and challenging mechanics.</li>
            <li><a href="#">Unity 2-Player Game</a> - A Unity project featuring a two-player game with movement, jumping, and AI-controlled NPCs that shoot projectiles.</li>
            <li><a href="#">Mobile Narrative Visualization</a> - A data-driven visualization project incorporating a waffle graph, interactive filtering, and timeline improvements.</li>
        </ul>
