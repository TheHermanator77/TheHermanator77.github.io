      <em>The Earthling</em> is a solo-developed 2D game created entirely in Unity. 
      This was my first complete game made from concept to completion. 
      I handled all aspects of development — including drawing and animating custom assets, 
      designing the mechanics, and programming the gameplay using C#. 
      The player must collect three keycards while navigating visual puzzles and clues, 
      all leading toward reaching a spaceship to escape the level. 
      Humor, hand-drawn style, and visual cues make the gameplay both intuitive and fun.

    <h2>Characters</h2>
    <p><strong>The Earthling:</strong> This is the original main character I designed, illustrated, and animated. 
    They serve as the face of the game and represent my first fully realized character brought to life with movement and expression in Unity.</p>

    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <p><strong>Keycard Objective:</strong> The keycards act as the primary objectives of the game. 
    The player must find and collect all three to advance. Their visual design includes humorous and intuitive cues 
    that guide the player without needing explicit instructions.</p>

    <p><strong>Spaceship Goal:</strong> The spaceship is the final destination of each level. Once all keycards are collected, 
    the player must reach the ship to escape. It serves both as a level-end trigger and as a narrative element 
    suggesting a larger mission to flee from danger or complete an off-world journey.</p>

    <h2>Space Background Environment</h2>
    <p>This space background sets the tone of the entire game, evoking a sense of being in deep space. 
    I designed it to be visually rich and immersive while helping anchor the player’s journey with a cohesive atmosphere.</p>
