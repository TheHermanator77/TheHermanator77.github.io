    <h2>Spaceship Goal Asset</h2>
    <p>
      This spaceship was designed as the end-goal of the game — representing escape and survival. Players navigate toward this ship, which functions as the final checkpoint and victory condition. It was modeled and illustrated specifically for <em>The Earthling</em>, and represents both artistic and gameplay integration.
